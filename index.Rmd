## Project Thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to health outcomes of four-year college students vs. the general public. I could focus on certain diseases and compare outcomes between the two groups to see if there are exacerbated differences in health outcomes. Doing a bit of research could help me narrow down the possible reasons as to why the resulting differences are.

## Written Proposal  

Does attending a four-year higher-education institution improve health outcomes? I believe that attending a four-year higher-ed. institution like a college in pursuit of a major leads to improved health outcomes in comparison to a person who might not go to college because an increase in financial stability will probably arise if they come from a low-income background. My reasoning is rooted in a theory called ecosocial theory of disease distribution by Nancy Krieger (1994), a renowned American epidemoiologist and professor atthe Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The ecosiocial theory of disease distribution is the belief that health outcomes are affected by numerous social determinants of health, including financial stability or income, and not just inherent ailment. On the basis of this theory, my hypothesis is sound in assuming that there might be some relationship between improved health outcomes and pursuing higher-education if a person came from a low-income background. We will be observing two groups, the past and ongoing health outcomes of young adults who graduated high school but did not attend college in pursuit of a bachelor's degree (control group) five years later and the past and ongoing health outcomes of young adults who graduated from college with a bachelor's degree (treatment group) five years later. The explanatory variables of interest is whether or not a person has graduated from college with their bachelor's degree or not. This can be measured using zeros for having not attended college and ones for having graduated college from an available data set, whether it be at a specific high school or the national level. My outcome variable of interest is potential changes in health outcomes which could be measured by the difference in the number or average number of re-admissions for healthcare delivery. The difference could be positive or negative. If positive, there has been improvement, and if negative, there has been declining in health outcomes. Both my explanatory and outcome variables showcase variation, allowing us to study these variables. Observed patterns in the data like a correlation via a linear regression could help us better understand the effects of education on health outcomes and come up with feasible ideas as to why that could possibly be. If there is a positive correlation between graduating from college successfully and improve in health outcomes, this will be evidence in favor of my alternative hypothesis. If there is a negative correlation between the aforementioned variables or no significant correlation found between them or being low-income and not having gone to college, this will become evidence against the null hypothesis. Regardless, this study will give us insight into a particular population and help to redirect efforts, if necessary, in the public-health sphere resources towards education, especially if not sufficient in the sector being observed.
